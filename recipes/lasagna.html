        <p>
            A classic lasagna recipe using hot Italian sausag.
            Don't be scared off by the long cooking time.

        <h3>
            Steps 
        </h3>

        <ol>
            <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>

            <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and olive oil; cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. </li>

           <li> Cook the ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain. Stir in the mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, basil, and tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper; simmer 30 minutes. </li>

            <li> Meanwhile, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. </li>

           <li> Ladle enough of the meat sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover the bottom in a thin layer. Form a layer atop the sauce with 3 of the lasagna noodles. Spread about 1/4 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese mixture and then ladle about 1/3 of the meat sauce over the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering twice more, topping with the remaining 1/4 pound of mozzarella cheese. </li> 

            <li> Bake in preheated oven 90 minutes. Allow to sit 10 to 15 minutes before serving. </li>
